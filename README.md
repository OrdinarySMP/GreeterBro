# Greeter Bro

**Greeter Bro** is a simple Minecraft mod that lets you automatically greet players when they join your game.
It's fully configurable via the **Mod Menu** UI and is perfect for SMP servers.

It supports servers with [**Styled Chat**](https://modrinth.com/mod/styled-chat), by allowing you to configure custom join messages to greet accordingly.

## Features

- **Auto Greeting on Join** – Automatically sends a chat message to welcome players.
- **First-Time Join Support** – Show a different message for new players (different join message from the server required).
- **Name Change Detection** – Greet players when they join after changing their name.
- **Player Blacklist** – Prevent specific players from being greeted.
- **Randomized Delay** – Greetings are sent after a random delay within a configurable time range.
